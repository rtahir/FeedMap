Install Instructions: (Read carefully!)

1. Disable your Network card or pull the network cable out.
   And make sure you dont have any of those entries in your hosts file
   127.0.0.1 lmlicenses.wip4.adobe.com
   127.0.0.1 lm.licenses.adobe.com
   Lets start clean :)

2. Install Adobe Acrobat XI Pro , Select Trial

3. Launch Adobe Acrobat XI
   Enter a Serial generated by our Keygen, DONT Close the Keygen or write your serial down
   When the error "Please connect to the internet and retry", shows click connect later.
   
4. Start or Restart Adobe Acrobat XI, after a while you will have an option
   To register (under Help Menu). Select and Confirm you have "connection problem" 
   and you want it to activate offline.

5. A request code will be generated. Use it with the serial you used to install adobe 
   to generate an activation code.

6. Validate it of course :). Dont Restart Adobe Acrobat BEFORE step7 is done

7. Run Osx/disable_activation_osx as root
   if you dont know how to do that, open a terminal window
   then issue sudo -s, a root shell will open
   then simply do "sh disable_activation_osx"  w/o the ""
   or ./disable_activation_osx( make it executable chmod 755 disable_activation_osx 
   you do that from the folder where disable_activation_osx is. (just copy it anywhere on your hdd) 

   Or do it manually
   Add the text below to the bottom of your hosts file. (/private/etc/hosts /et/hosts)

# Adobe Blocker

127.0.0.1 lmlicenses.wip4.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 lm.licenses.adobe.com

8. After it has been activated re-enable you Network card and run the adobe updater to update your software to the latest version.

9. Enjoy!


Note: If you encounter any issues with a previous installation / crack, please
uninstall and delete those folders :

./Library/Application Support/Adobe/SLStore
./Library/Application Support/Adobe/SLCache


If you re-install or want to install another application
Before entering your serial
Make sure your host file is clean and your internet is blocked a way or another, start at Step 1
